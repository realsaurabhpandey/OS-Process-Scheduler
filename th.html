            What is CPU Scheduling?
            CPU Scheduling is a process of determining which process will own CPU for execution while another process is on hold. The main task of CPU scheduling is to make sure that whenever the CPU remains idle, the OS at least select one of the processes available in the ready queue for execution. The selection process will be carried out by the CPU scheduler. It selects one of the processes in memory that are ready for execution.
            
            In this CPU scheduling tutorial, you will learn:

               <br>
               Types of CPU Scheduling
               Here are two kinds of Scheduling methods:
               
               
               Preemptive Scheduling
               In Preemptive Scheduling, the tasks are mostly assigned with their priorities. Sometimes it is important to run a task with a higher priority before another lower priority task, even if the lower priority task is still running. The lower priority task holds for some time and resumes when the higher priority task finishes its execution.
               
               Non-Preemptive Scheduling
               In this type of scheduling method, the CPU has been allocated to a specific process. The process that keeps the CPU busy will release the CPU either by switching context or terminating. It is the only method that can be used for various hardware platforms. That’s because it doesn’t need special hardware (for example, a timer) like preemptive scheduling.
               
               When scheduling is Preemptive or Non-Preemptive?
               To determine if scheduling is preemptive or non-preemptive, consider these four parameters:
               
               A process switches from the running to the waiting state.
               Specific process switches from the running state to the ready state.
               Specific process switches from the waiting state to the ready state.
               Process finished its execution and terminated.
               Only conditions 1 and 4 apply, the scheduling is called non- preemptive.
               
               All other scheduling are preemptive.
               
               Important CPU scheduling Terminologies
               Burst Time/Execution Time: It is a time required by the process to complete execution. It is also called running time.
               Arrival Time: when a process enters in a ready state
               Finish Time: when process complete and exit from a system
               Multiprogramming: A number of programs which can be present in memory at the same time.
               Jobs: It is a type of program without any kind of user interaction.
               User: It is a kind of program having user interaction.
               Process: It is the reference that is used for both job and user.
               CPU/IO burst cycle: Characterizes process execution, which alternates between CPU and I/O activity. CPU times are usually shorter than the time of I/O.
               CPU Scheduling Criteria
               A CPU scheduling algorithm tries to maximize and minimize the following:
               
               
               Maximize:
               CPU utilization: CPU utilization is the main task in which the operating system needs to make sure that CPU remains as busy as possible. It can range from 0 to 100 percent. However, for the RTOS, it can be range from 40 percent for low-level and 90 percent for the high-level system.
               
               Throughput: The number of processes that finish their execution per unit time is known Throughput. So, when the CPU is busy executing the process, at that time, work is being done, and the work completed per unit time is called Throughput.
               
               Minimize:
               Waiting time: Waiting time is an amount that specific process needs to wait in the ready queue.
               
               Response time: It is an amount to time in which the request was submitted until the first response is produced.
               
               Turnaround Time: Turnaround time is an amount of time to execute a specific process. It is the calculation of the total time spent waiting to get into the memory, waiting in the queue and, executing on the CPU. The period between the time of process submission to the completion time is the turnaround time.
               
               Interval Timer
               Timer interruption is a method that is closely related to preemption. When a certain process gets the CPU allocation, a timer may be set to a specified interval. Both timer interruption and preemption force a process to return the CPU before its CPU burst is complete.
               
               Most of the multi-programmed operating system uses some form of a timer to prevent a process from tying up the system forever.
               
               What is Dispatcher?
               It is a module that provides control of the CPU to the process. The Dispatcher should be fast so that it can run on every context switch. Dispatch latency is the amount of time needed by the CPU scheduler to stop one process and start another.
               
               Functions performed by Dispatcher:
               
               Context Switching
               Switching to user mode
               Moving to the correct location in the newly loaded program.

            Types of CPU scheduling Algorithm
            There are mainly six types of process scheduling algorithms
            
            First Come First Serve (FCFS)
            Shortest-Job-First (SJF) Scheduling
            Shortest Remaining Time
            Priority Scheduling
            Round Robin Scheduling
            Multilevel Queue Scheduling
